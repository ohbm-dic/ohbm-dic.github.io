The Diversity and Inclusivity Committee (DIC) at OHBM organizes the annual Brain Mappers of Tomorrow (formerly Multilingual Kids Live Review) events in 2026. This is a free event for all, including non-OHBM members!

In 2023, we hosted 17 sessions in 12 different languages to connect the scientists at OHBM to children/youths (8-15 years old) all over the world. The main objective of these presentations is to have children learn about your scientific work and get them excited about science and the brain. In a 1-hour session, the presenter will talk about their research on various topics related to the human brain and interact with children during the Q&A.

Given that the 2026 annual meeting of OHBM takes place in France (June 14–18, 2026), we will have an in-person live review during the OHBM meeting in Bordeaux. A team of neuroscientists will present their latest scientific discoveries to our young audience. What makes this event truly special is the LIVE peer review: three young reviewers, who have read the scientists’ research manuscripts in advance, will ask questions and decide whether the manuscripts should be “Accepted with revisions” or “Rejected” based on the scientists’ response—just like a real scientific peer review process. And it all happens live, in front of an audience! This year, we are once again collaborating with the kid-friendly journal *Frontiers for Young Minds*, and the accepted manuscript will have the opportunity to be published in this journal.
