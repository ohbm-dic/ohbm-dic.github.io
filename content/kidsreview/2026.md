The Diversity and Inclusivity Committee (DIC) at OHBM at OHBM is once again hosting the Brain Mappers of Tomorrow (formerly Multilingual Kids Live Review) events in 2026. This is a free event for all, including non-OHBM members!

In the past, we hosted over 20 sessions in 15 different languages to connect the scientists at OHBM to children/youths (8-15 years old) all over the world. The main objective of these presentations is to have children learn about your scientific work and get them excited about science and the brain. In a 1-hour session, the presenter will talk about their research on various topics related to the human brain and interact with children during the Q&A.

Given that the 2026 annual meeting of OHBM takes place in France (June 14–18, 2026), we will have an in-person live review during the OHBM meeting in Bordeaux. A team of neuroscientists will present their latest scientific discoveries to our young audience. What makes this event truly special is the LIVE peer review: two to three young reviewers, who have read the scientists’ research manuscripts in advance, will ask questions and decide whether the manuscripts should be “Accepted with revisions” or “Rejected” based on the scientists’ response—just like a real scientific peer review process. And it all happens live, in front of an audience! This year, we are once again collaborating with the kid-friendly journal *Frontiers for Young Minds*, and the accepted manuscript will have the opportunity to be published in this journal.

Currently, we are looking for a group of researchers to present in French at the OHBM annual meeting.


- French language in-person session, closes on March 31: [https://forms.gle/vFUQqvAJVx65RUmx5](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wso2tc_G_XvAtbznCyjEaxzj6oBgdhB2h3OW03FYC3M/edit)

  We are also looking for volunteer organizers for the satellite sessions. We will work with the organizers to coordinate a presenter as well as identify potential young audience members in their local community.
  
- All other satellite language sessions, closes on April 30 : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QPhdHc5hpQOQHKh10wrLRJjVnYWEVVqX_iBVtCxhUME/edit

<strong>This is a valuable opportunity, especially for early career researchers, to contribute to the community, engage in meaningful outreach, and strengthen the service component of their CV.</strong>

If you are planning to host a session in English, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese or French it is possible to submit with our support a manuscript to Frontiers for Young Minds (https://kids.frontiersin.org/). Please get in touch for more information!
