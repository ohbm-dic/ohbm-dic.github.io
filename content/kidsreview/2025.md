The Diversity and Inclusivity Committee (DIC) at OHBM organizes the annual Brain Mappers of Tomorrow (formerly Multilingual Kids Live Review) events in 2025 (FREE events). 

In 2023, we hosted 17 1-hour sessions in 12 different languages to connect the scientists from today at OHBM to children (8-15 years old) all over the world. The main objective of these presentations is to have children learn about your scientific work and get them excited about science and the brain. In a 1-hour session, the presenter will talk about the human brain and her/his research on various topics (about 15 minutess) and communicate with children during the Q & A time (about 45 minutes). 

<!--
UPDATE INTRO TEXT!
 In addition, given that the 2025 annual meeting of OHBM takes place in South Korea (June 23, 2024 - June 27, 2024), one of our Korean sessions will be organized as an in-person event during the OHBM main meeting (Seoul, COEX Conference Room E1, on June 24th from 6-7pm).

Currently, we are looking for volunteer organizers for local ans satellite BMT sessions.
