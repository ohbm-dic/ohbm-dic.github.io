In this session, we will explore early brain development, focusing on the fundamental roles and composition of the brain, and how it develops as children grow! Through interactive activities, we will examine how the brain processes information, makes decisions, and controls emotions, illustrating how changes in brain wiring are crucial for cognitive development. Students will also explore various factors that impact brain development and discover practical strategies to help protect and maintain their brain health!</description></item></channel></rss>
